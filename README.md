# Research Project: Analysis of Fertility Rates 

## Project description: 
This repository contains the code for the final course project of PSTAT 100 (Data Science Concepts & Analysis) at the University of California, Santa Barbara taken in Spring 2023. This project presents students with a chance to practice the data science life cycle and demonstrate understanding of course concepts such as inference and prediction, principles of measurement, missing data, and notions of causality.

My project focuses on a specific case study of fertility rates and seeks to extract insights regarding its decline. I begin by providing background information, specifying my data sources and motivation, and conducting exploratory analysis to hone in my research questions. I then carry out a focused analysis to examine the factors most predictive of fertility rates in select developed nations. In doing so, I will employ several machine learning techniques and utilize scientific computing tools in Python (numpy, pandas, altair) to facilitate my analysis. Lastly, I will prepare a written summary of my work, summarizing my findings and proposing recommendations for further analysis. 

## Problem statement
Over the late 50 years the global fertility rate has halved. The modernization of socieities was coupled with a stark decline in fertility rates and accelerated population growth, which was predicted to come to an end as the fertility rate continues to declines and approaches 2 children per woman. Today (as of 2021), the global fertility rate is 1.66 and falling. The total fertility rate is measured as the average number of children per woman. 

Current perspectives propose that this sharp decline in fertility rates is due to the social mobility of women – through education, labor force participation, and strengthened women’s rights – and the increased well-being and status of children. We seek to examine such perspectives in exploring the relationship between fertility rates and country, gender, and human development indicators. 

## Data sources
Data are sourced from the Human Development Reports published by the United Nations Development Programme and World Development Indicators published by the World Bank. Preprocessed datasets were imported from [lab06](https://github.com/ucsb-ds/pstat100-content/tree/main/labs/lab6-regression/data).
