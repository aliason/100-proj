## Research project: Fertility Rates

This research project examines the decline in fertility rates acrossed select developed nations in 2018. We investigate the relationships between fertility, economic welfare, and social welfare by analyzing the contribution of select country, gender, and social indicators to total fertility rates.

Over the late 50 years the global fertility rate has halved. The modernization of socieities – bringing improved health and lower mortality rates – was coupled with a stark decline in fertility rates. We in turn saw accelerated population growth. This rapid population growth was predicted to come to an end as the fertility rate declines and approaches 2 children per woman. Today (as of 2021), the global fertility rate is 1.66 and falling. The total fertility rate is measured as the average number of children per woman.
Current perspectives propose that this sharp decline in fertility rates is due to the social mobility of women – through education, labor force participation, and strengthened women’s rights – and the increased well-being and status of children. We seek to examine such perspectives in exploring the relationship between fertility rates and country, gender, and human development indicators.

Data are sourced from the Human Development Reports published by the United Nations Development Programme and World Development Indicators published by the World Bank. Preprocessed datasets were imported from a lab in the course.
