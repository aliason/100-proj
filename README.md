# Research Project: Analysis of Fertility Rates 

## Project description: 
This repository contains the code for the final course project of PSTAT 100 (Data Science Concepts & Analysis) at the University of California, Santa Barbara taken in Spring 2023. Students practice the data science lifecycle on a research topic of their choosing, demonstrating key course concepts such as inference and prediction, principles of measurement, missing data, and notions of causality.

My project examines the decline in fertility rates across select developed nations in 2018 and seeks to quantify the contribution of gender, country, and world development indicators to total fertility rates. I will be conducting in-depth analysis of fertility data in Python and implementing multiple techniques to address my research questions.  

## Problem statement
Over the late 50 years, the global fertility rate has halved. Modernization and technological advancements were coupled with a stark decline in fertility rates and accelerated population growth, which was predicted to come to an end as total fertility rates – measured as the average number of children per woman – continue to fall. As of 2021, the global fertility rate is 1.66 and falling.  

Current perspectives attribute this decline to the social mobility of women; economic and political stability; and the increased well-being of children. But can we be certain? Which explaination is more probable, or are all of them equally valid? Through what means do upward mobility, economic prosperity, or improved well-being impact total fertility rates? Which ones are most predictive of a country's fertility rates? These questions, and more, will be explored in this project. 

## Data sources
Data are sourced from the [United Nations Development Programme](https://www.undp.org/) and the [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/). Preprocessed datasets were imported from [lab06](https://github.com/ucsb-ds/pstat100-content/tree/main/labs/lab6-regression/data). 


## Project outline 
First, I will provide background information, specify my data sources, and define my research questions. I will then conduct exploratory analysis and refine the dataset to isolate my factors of interest, using Python data science libraries to facilitate data cleaning and visualization. I perform correlation analysis to inspect relationships; prinicpal component analysis (PCA) to identify key drivers of variability; and multiple regression analysis t
