# Research Project: Analysis of Fertility Rates 

## Project description: 
This repository contains the code for the final course project of PSTAT 100 (Data Science Concepts & Analysis) at the University of California, Santa Barbara taken in Spring 2023. This project presents students with a chance to practice the data science life cycle through research on a topic of their choosing and demonstrate course concepts such as predictive modeling, principles of measurement, missing data, and notions of causality.

My project conducts a case study on the decline in fertility rates across select developed nations in 2018 and seeks to identify the factors most predictive of this decline. To this end, I will be conducting an in-depth analysis of total fertility rates and implementing multiple techniques to yield insight into my research questions.  

## Problem statement
Over the late 50 years, the global fertility rate has halved. Modernization and technological advancements were coupled with a stark decline in fertility rates and accelerated population growth, which was predicted to come to an end as total fertility rates, measured as the average # of children per woman, continue to fall. Today (as of 2021), the global fertility rate is 1.66 and falling.  

Current perspectives attribute this decline to the social mobility of women; economic and political stability; and the increased well-being of children (as measured by a decline in mortality rates). But can we be certain? Which explaination is more probable, or are all of them equally valid? Through what means do upward mobility, economic prosperity, or improved well-being impact total fertility rates? Which factors are most predictive of a country's fertility rates, and how can we quantify their relationship?

These questions, and more, will be explored in this project as we examine the effect of gender, country, and world development indicators on total fertility rates. 

## Data sources
Data are sourced from the [United Nations Development Programme](https://www.undp.org/) and the [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/). Preprocessed datasets were imported from [lab06](https://github.com/ucsb-ds/pstat100-content/tree/main/labs/lab6-regression/data). 


## Project outline 
First, I will provide background information, specify my data sources, and define my research questions. I will then conduct exploratory analysis and refine the dataset to isolate my factors of interest, using Python data science libraries to facilitate data cleaning and visualization. I perform correlation analysis to inspect relationships; prinicpal component analysis (PCA) to identify key drivers of variability; and multiple regression analysis t
